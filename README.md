# Portfolio Site
This will be a site that demonstrates my skills as well as detailed descriptions of my projects. Additional features will be a dashboard to easily add projects as well as an email list which will collect emails of people who would be interested in hearing updates about my progress.

## Goals
1. Email List
2. Portfolio
3. Blog
4. Speed & SEO
5. Dynamic

## Stack
Stack is made with the goal of learning and understanding new technologies while using tools that are practical for the use-case.

### Language: Golang
I am choosing to use Golang for this project because it is a tool that is increasing in popularity and I will heavily benefit from learning to use it. Other advantages include ease of use and speed.

### Frontend: React (Next.js)
I have experience with React and Next.js and want to continue using this approach due to the speed provided by SSR.

### Database: TBD

### Deployment: Railway
Railway has been my choice method of deploying applications for the past few years. Features like scaling, automatic deploys, and private networking will be useful.
